				Machines capable of playing chess have fascinated people since the latter half of the 18th century,
				when the Turk, the first of the pseudo-automatons, began a triumphal exhibition tour of Europe. 
				Like its 19th-century successor Ajeeb, the Turk was a cleverly constructed cabinet that concealed 
				a human master. The mystery of the Turk was the subject of more than a dozen books and a widely 
				discussed article written by Edgar Allan Poe in 1836. Several world-class players were employed to 
				operate the pseudo-automatons, including Harry Nelson Pillsbury, who was Ajeeb during part of the 1890s, 
				and Isidor Gunsberg and Jean Taubenhaus, who operated, by remote control, Mephisto, the last of the 
				pseudo-automatons, before it was dismantled following World War I.
