					During World War II, Turing was a leading cryptanalyst at the Government Code and Cypher School in Bletchley Park,
					Buckinghamshire, England. Turing could not turn to the project of building a stored-program electronic computing 
					machine until the cessation of hostilities in Europe in 1945. Nevertheless, during the war he gave considerable 
					thought to the issue of machine intelligence. One of Turing’s colleagues at Bletchley Park, Donald Michie 
					(who later founded the Department of Machine Intelligence and Perception at the University of Edinburgh), 
					later recalled that Turing often discussed how computers could learn from experience as well as solve new problems
					through the use of guiding principles a process now known as heuristic problem solving.
					Turing gave quite possibly the earliest public lecture (London, 1947) to mention computer intelligence,
					saying, "What we want is a machine that can learn from experience, "and that the "possibility of letting
			`		the machine alter its own instructions provides the mechanism for this." In 1948 he introduced many of the central
					concepts of AI in a report entitled “Intelligent Machinery." However, Turing did not publish this paper, 
					and many of his ideas were later reinvented by others. For instance, one of Turing’s original ideas was to train 
					a network of artificial neurons to perform specific tasks, an approach described in the section Connectionism.
