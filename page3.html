				In agriculture new AI advancements show improvements in gaining yield and to increase the research and 
				development of growing crops. New artificial intelligence now predicts the time it takes for a crop like
				a tomato to be ripe and ready for picking thus increasing efficiency of farming.

			<td>
				In future classrooms, ambient informatics can play a beneficial role. Ambient informatics is the idea 
				that information is everywhere in the environment and that technologies automatically adjust to your 
				personal preferences.[22] Study devices could be able to create lessons, problems, and games to tailor 
				to the specific student's needs, and give immediate feedback.

			Artificial neural networks are used as clinical decision support systems for medical diagnosis, 
			such as in Concept Processing technology in EMR software.Other tasks in medicine that can potentially 
			be performed by artificial intelligence and are beginning to be developed include:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Computer-aided interpretation of medical images. Such systems help scan digital images, 
					e.g. from computed tomography, for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, 
					such as possible diseases. A typical application is the detection of a tumor.
				</li>
				<li>Heart sound analysis</li>
				<li>Companion robots for the care of the elderly</li>
				<li>Mining medical records to provide more useful information.</li>
				<li>Design treatment plans.</li>
